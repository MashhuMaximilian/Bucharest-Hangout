*Data Science Capstone - IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera*

## Introduction 

Let's say you have never been to the US and you want to visit as many coffee shops near the place you stay while you are there. So you want to go to a place with a high density of Coffee Shops around you. The problem we aim to solve is to analyze the Coffee Shops' locations in some of the major US cities and find the best place for our tourist so that he can have a good pizza-ourism. 

## Data section 

I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of Coffee Shops in 5 major US cities which are: Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Houston, and Boston. These are one of the most populated US cities and I am hopeful that they will contain the best coffee shops in the US.
